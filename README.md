# responsive-it

A simple template made with React & styled components to show a website as a mobile first ux 🥳

# Use: ✨
``` git clone https://github.com/RevanHUB/responsiveit/ ```

Or you can just go to releases and download it: 

``` https://github.com/RevanHUB/responsiveit/releases/ ``` 

Open screen-media.jsx inside src/components and change: 
         ```  <iframe id="9348" src="/*THE URL IN YOUR DOMAIN*/" ></iframe>``` 


# Know Issues: ✨

* ``` In order to make it work with PHP, the files must be in the same domain due to cors issues ✔️ ```
* ``` Controls on main website applies to iframe controls, it's intended and it won't be changed in this release ✔️```


It's simple but usefull! Hope you like it! 🥰
